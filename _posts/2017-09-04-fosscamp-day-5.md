As usual, after having breakfast, we all meet at the cafeteria.
Today, we keep translating the Debian installer (and some packages) and [Anxhelo Lushka](https://lushka.al/) showed us how to contribute with LibreOffice translation.

We then wen to visit the [Industrial Museum of Ermoupoli](http://www.ketepo.gr/en/).
Quite interesting and really impressed by all the things done, for instance, Syros produced the Enfield 8000, an electrical car from 1973 (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfield_8000>).

Lunch, back to the cafeteria and back to work.

Lior is the first one to leave, the end of FOSSCamp 2017 is unfortunately near â€¦

Great achievement, we succeeded to translate 99% of the Debian installer into Albanian language ; work is almost complete :

Thanks again for the huge help provided by Lior Kaplan.
