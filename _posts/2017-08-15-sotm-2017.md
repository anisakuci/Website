State of the Map is the annual event for all mappers and OpenStreetMap users. The event will last three days in the central Japan with talks, discussions, workshops, code and documentation sprints all around the free and open map of the world.

I am really excited this year to participate to State of the Map 2017 and hold a presentation about Community building, attend other presentations and workshops related to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) projects, and learn more about everything related to it, and meet members from other countries communities. This will be, as far as I know, the first presence of Albanian based OSM contributors to a SoTM edition. I will participate along with my fellow friend and OSM contributor [Sidorela Uku](https://twitter.com/search?q=sidorela&src=typd).
During the next days Iâ€™ll be updating this post with photos and videos from the event.

I will also update regularly [my twitter](https://twitter.com/AnisaKuci) account.
