Last day of FOSSCamp 2017, time to wrap things up !

Meeting at the beach to talk about this edition of FOSSCamp ; what went well, what went wrong, â€¦
I think that everyone agrees that FOSSCamp 2017 was awesome ! Everyone seemed to have a great time !
Some notes on what could be improved for the next edition :

* Fixed venue
* Double track (so people can choose which track they want to assist to)
* More talks/presentations
* Be able to submit talks/workshops before the event

Free time at the beach to enjoy the sea for the last time.

Then, as usual, back at our regular place to wrap everything up : finish the pending work and describe what we did during the week.

Then time to enjoy the Syros night life for the last time ;
Without forgetting to wish an happy birthday to [Anxhelo Lushka](https://lushka.al/) !

Thanks to Open Labs (<https://openlabs.cc/>) and Ura Design (<https://ura.design/>) for this awesome event !
Special thanks to [Mandrakoukos Syrianos](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/173717645) for hosting us everyday, the warm welcoming, the delicious drinks and the WiFi connection.
